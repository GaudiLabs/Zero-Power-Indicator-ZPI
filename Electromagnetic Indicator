Electromagnetism involves the mechanical moving or flipping of an object with an embedded permanent magnet, using the electromagnetic field created by alternately powered electromagnetic coils via short pulses, which attract or repel the object. This is the technology behind Flipdots or Flip discs, a classic in display design. 
While initially sceptical due to electromagnetism’s relatively high power usage, the difficulty of making a stable device with moving parts, and the problematics of the materials (rare earth magnets and copper coils), we decided to create some prototypes which try to circumvent these issues. With small, delicate design, we were sure we could bring down the current draw, compounded by the fact that, since bistable, even a short pulse of higher current than an LED will quickly pay off after not flipping for sometime, while an LED stays on using power continuously.
