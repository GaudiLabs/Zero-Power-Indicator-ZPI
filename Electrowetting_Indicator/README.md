# electrowetting indicator technology
Documentation and reference implementations for electrochromic indicator technology. Includes fabrication methods, and example code for bistable display applications.

Electrowetting uses an applied voltage to change the surface tension of a liquid droplet on a hydrophobic surface, allowing control of colored liquid to modulate light transmission or reflection. We produce the OpenDrop, a research device for digital microfluidics using electrowetting. https://github.com/GaudiLabs/OpenDrop While this was primarily designed for scientific research, there are also those looking into it as a possible display technology. 

We attempted bistable indicators with a single pixel, as well as more complex symbols e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMjT6OE5fMg
