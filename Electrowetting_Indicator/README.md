# electrowetting indicator technology
Documentation and reference implementations for electrochromic indicator technology. Includes fabrication methods, and example code for bistable display applications.

Electrowetting uses an applied voltage to change the surface tension of a liquid droplet on a hydrophobic surface, allowing control of colored liquid to modulate light transmission or reflection.
